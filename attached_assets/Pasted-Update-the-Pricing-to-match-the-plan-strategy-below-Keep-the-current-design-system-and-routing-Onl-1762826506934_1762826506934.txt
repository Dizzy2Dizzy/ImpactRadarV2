Required UI changes
	1.	In app/pricing/page.tsx (or wherever the pricing cards live), replace the plan bullets with the lists above.
	2.	Add a 7-day free trial CTA on the Pro card: button label Start 7-day Free Trial. Wire to /signup?plan=pro&trial=7.
	3.	Free card button = Get Started → /signup?plan=free.
	4.	Team card button = Contact Sales → /contact?topic=team.
	5.	Add a small note under Pro price: Billed monthly. Cancel anytime.
	6.	Add tooltips for these terms:
	•	Real-time event feed: “Events delivered without delay while markets are open.”
	•	Priority/Dedicated computation lane: “Your scans are scheduled ahead of free users to reduce time-to-signal.”
	•	API access (10k/100k calls): “Rate-limited requests per month across REST endpoints.”
	7.	Add a compact comparison table below the cards that mirrors the features (✔ Free / ✔ Pro / ✔ Team). Keep it 2–3 columns, mobile-scrollable.
	8.	Keep the current styling (dark, rounded, subtle outlines). Preserve accessibility and keyboard focus.

Implementation details
	•	Source of truth: create marketing/data/plans.ts exporting the three plans and a flat feature matrix used by both cards and the table.
	•	Components to update (create if missing):
	•	components/pricing/Plans.tsx (cards)
	•	components/pricing/Comparison.tsx (table)
	•	components/ui/Tooltip.tsx (reuse if already present)
	•	Add simple plan types:

export type PlanId = 'free' | 'pro' | 'team';


	•	Add tests/smoke: render pricing page, ensure all bullet strings exist.

Copy blocks (exact strings)
	•	Page title: Pricing built for traders
	•	Subtitle: Start free. Scale as you grow. No hidden fees, cancel anytime.
	•	Pro badge: Most Popular

Acceptance criteria
	•	Pricing page builds with no TypeScript errors.
	•	Cards show the exact bullets above.
	•	Pro card shows Start 7-day Free Trial and links to /signup?plan=pro&trial=7.
	•	Comparison table matches the cards.
	•	Mobile layout stays readable and tappable.
	•	Lighthouse a11y ≥ 90 on the pricing route.

Do not change colors, spacing, or typography outside the pricing section.
