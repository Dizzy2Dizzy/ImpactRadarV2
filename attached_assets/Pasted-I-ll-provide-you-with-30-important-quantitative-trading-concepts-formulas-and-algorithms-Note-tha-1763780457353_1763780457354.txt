I'll provide you with 30 important quantitative trading concepts, formulas, and algorithms. Note that no formula guarantees profits—successful trading requires proper risk management, market understanding, and adaptive strategies.

## **Price & Return Metrics**

1. **Simple Return**: R = (P₁ - P₀) / P₀
2. **Log Return**: r = ln(P₁/P₀) - more suitable for compounding
3. **Sharpe Ratio**: (Rₚ - Rₓ) / σₚ - risk-adjusted return measure
4. **Sortino Ratio**: (Rₚ - Rₓ) / σd - focuses only on downside deviation
5. **Maximum Drawdown**: MDD = (Trough - Peak) / Peak

## **Moving Averages & Trends**

6. **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: SMA = Σ(Prices) / n
7. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: EMA = Price(t) × k + EMA(y) × (1-k), where k = 2/(n+1)
8. **MACD**: MACD = EMA(12) - EMA(26), Signal = EMA(9) of MACD
9. **Bollinger Bands**: Middle = SMA(20), Upper/Lower = SMA ± 2σ
10. **ADX (Trend Strength)**: Measures trend strength from 0-100

## **Mean Reversion**

11. **Z-Score**: Z = (X - μ) / σ - identifies overbought/oversold
12. **Pairs Trading Spread**: Spread = Stock A - β × Stock B
13. **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process**: dX = θ(μ - X)dt + σdW - mean reversion model
14. **Hurst Exponent**: H < 0.5 (mean reverting), H > 0.5 (trending)

## **Momentum Indicators**

15. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: RSI = 100 - [100/(1 + RS)], where RS = Avg Gain/Avg Loss
16. **Momentum**: M = Price(t) - Price(t-n)
17. **Rate of Change (ROC)**: ROC = [(Price(t) - Price(t-n)) / Price(t-n)] × 100
18. **Stochastic Oscillator**: %K = (Close - Low₁₄) / (High₁₄ - Low₁₄) × 100

## **Volatility Models**

19. **Historical Volatility**: σ = √[Σ(rᵢ - r̄)² / (n-1)] × √252
20. **GARCH(1,1)**: σ²ₜ = ω + α·ε²ₜ₋₁ + β·σ²ₜ₋₁ - volatility forecasting
21. **ATR (Average True Range)**: ATR = MA of True Range over n periods
22. **Parkinson Volatility**: Uses high-low prices for better estimation

## **Options & Greeks**

23. **Black-Scholes**: C = S₀N(d₁) - Ke⁻ʳᵗN(d₂)
24. **Delta**: ∂V/∂S - rate of change of option price with stock price
25. **Implied Volatility**: Solve Black-Scholes backwards for σ

## **Risk Management**

26. **Kelly Criterion**: f* = (bp - q) / b - optimal position sizing
27. **Value at Risk (VaR)**: VaR = μ - z·σ - maximum expected loss
28. **Position Sizing**: Position = (Account × Risk%) / Stop Loss Distance

## **Statistical Arbitrage**

29. **Cointegration Test**: ADF test on spread between correlated assets
30. **Kalman Filter**: Recursive algorithm for dynamic hedge ratios and trend estimation

## **Important Considerations:**

**Risk Factors:**
- **Overfitting**: Algorithms that work on historical data may fail in live markets
- **Transaction costs**: Commissions and slippage significantly impact profitability
- **Market regime changes**: Markets evolve; strategies must adapt
- **Liquidity**: Some algorithms work only in liquid markets
- **Leverage risks**: Amplifies both gains and losses

**Best Practices:**
- Always backtest with out-of-sample data
- Use walk-forward analysis
- Implement proper risk management (stop losses, position sizing)
- Diversify across strategies and assets
- Monitor performance metrics continuously
- Account for slippage and commissions in backtests

**Reality Check:**
Most quantitative hedge funds combine multiple strategies, use machine learning for pattern recognition, and employ teams of PhDs. Retail traders should focus on:
- Risk management first
- Simple, robust strategies
- Continuous learning and adaptation
- Starting small and scaling gradually

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific algorithm or help you understand how to implement any of these in a trading strategy?
