I’ve inspected:
	•	The zips you uploaded (impact-radar-backend, docs-and-marketing-copy, etc.) via code.
	•	README.md, INFO_TIERS.md, SECURITY.md, SCORING.md, FEATURE_MAP.md, EVALUATION_REPORT.md, backend tests and docs.
	•	The GIFs you attached (dashboard, modeling workspace, trade signals, analytics, etc.).

I cannot actually browse your live URL or Google Drive, so I can’t click around the deployed app; I’m basing this on your code, docs, and the screen recordings.

Below is a structured critique in the six perspectives you asked for, plus concrete next steps.

⸻

1. First-Time User Perspective

What works
	•	Visual first impression
	•	Dark, professional UI; clear left sidebar; consistent card design.
	•	Top-level sections (“Overview, Events, Trade Signals, Modeling, Backtesting, Accuracy, RadarQuant AI”) make the product feel serious, not toy-like.
	•	Dashboard Overview
	•	“Portfolio Value / Total Change / Percent Change” at the top is intuitive.
	•	“Most Impactful Events” and “Recent High-Impact Events” cards make it obvious that this is an event-driven tool.
	•	Side navigation
	•	Sections grouped logically:
	•	MARKET DATA (Events, Calendar, Companies, Sectors)
	•	TRADING (Trade Signals, Alerts)
	•	ANALYTICS (Correlation, Backtesting, Modeling, Data Quality, Accuracy)
	•	SYSTEM / AI / SETTINGS
	•	For someone used to trading dashboards, this feels familiar.

Where first-time users will get lost
	1.	No single “what do I do first?” path
	•	The GIFs show many powerful tabs but no “Start here” overlay.
	•	Docs describe a very clear conceptual workflow:
Event → Impact Score → Model Prediction → Trade Signal / Playbook.
	•	That workflow is not surfaced in the UI as a guided sequence.
Concrete fix:
	•	Add a top-level banner or “Getting Started checklist” on the Dashboard:
	1.	Connect or upload your portfolio.
	2.	Add tickers to your watchlist.
	3.	Turn on event alerts.
	4.	Review today’s trade signals.
	5.	Optional: Open Playbooks to learn how to trade each setup.
	2.	Too much analytic surface area up front
	•	Tabs like “Modeling → Topology Analyzer / Strategy Lab” are intellectually impressive but cognitively heavy for a new user.
	•	For a first-timer, this looks like a research platform more than “tool that helps me trade better this week”.
Concrete fix:
	•	Mark Modeling / Topology as Advanced in the sidebar (small “Advanced” tag) and move it below the trading workflow sections.
	•	In the first-run experience, hide advanced tabs behind a “Show advanced analytics” toggle.
	3.	Impact scores vs. direction not immediately intuitive
	•	Docs are very clear: deterministic impact score 20–95, directional labels, confidence levels, ML-refinements.
	•	On cards, the user only sees “Impact: +0.50%” or score numbers without “this is good/bad, expect X–Y% move in Z days”.
Concrete fix:
	•	On each event card, surface a simple “Expectation chip”:
	•	“Bullish bias, 5-day horizon, +1.2% expected move (moderate confidence)”
	•	Add hover help: “Impact score is 65/100 – historically events like this move price by ~0.8% over 5 days.”
	4.	Playbooks not visible as a core feature
	•	In docs you emphasize playbooks (“How we trade earnings beats”, “FDA approvals”) but in the UI they’re not prominent in the GIFs.
	•	For a first-time user, playbooks are the easiest entry point; they turn abstraction into “click this, here’s how to trade it.”
Concrete fix:
	•	Give “Playbooks” its own top-level left-nav item under TRADING (not buried under docs/blog).
	•	On Dashboard, show a “Recommended Playbook of the Day” card linking to a concrete example.

⸻

2. Paying Day/Swing Trader Perspective

What traders will like
	•	Trade Signals tab
	•	Cards with ticker, entry, stop, take profit, R/R ratio, and expiry look exactly like what a swing trader expects.
	•	Position size suggestions (2.6% in the GIF) give a risk-based feel.
	•	Event context
	•	Each signal is linked back to an event type (e.g., “Based on sec_8k event with impact score 60 and bearish direction”), which builds trust.
	•	Accuracy / Evaluation docs explicitly discuss win rate, MAE, and sample sizes instead of vague marketing.
	•	Backtesting & Modeling
	•	Even if most traders never use persistent homology, seeing Strategy Lab equity curves and topological metrics boosts perceived depth and seriousness.

Friction / missing pieces for traders
	1.	Execution workflow gap
	•	Traders will ask: “How do I actually place this trade?”
	•	The product currently stops at “signal → suggested entry/stop/target”.
Suggested approach (short-term):
	•	Provide broker-agnostic export: a small “Copy to clipboard: Entry/Stop/Target” button per signal, formatted as:
AAPL long @ 271.14, SL 257.58, TP 299.61, size 2.6% of equity.
	•	Optional: a read-only “Broker Integration (coming soon)” footer; don’t promise features you don’t have.
	2.	Win-rate and sample size must be front and center
	•	EVALUATION_REPORT.md shows you’re tracking things like:
	•	1-day directional accuracy ~XX% (placeholder here, you had real numbers)
	•	Event coverage, neutral classifications, etc.
	•	A paying trader will not dig into docs; they want this on the Accuracy tab and on the Pricing page.
Concrete fix:
	•	On Accuracy tab:
	•	For each model/horizon show:
Win rate, MAE, sample size (N events), backtest period.
	•	On Pricing page:
	•	“Current live 5-day directional accuracy on signals: 72% over N trades (rolling last 90 days). Not a guarantee of future performance.”
	3.	Direction coverage honesty
	•	SCORING.md and EVALUATION_REPORT.md emphasise that many events are labeled neutral because the deterministic classifier won’t force a direction.
	•	This is good, but marketing must match:
	•	Don’t say “We predict direction on all events.”
	•	Say “We only flag direction when signal strength and historical patterns are strong enough.”
Concrete fix:
	•	On Events tab, clearly label:
	•	“Directional Rating: Bullish/Bearish/Neutral/Uncertain.”
	•	Add a quick legend: “We only issue directional calls when historical patterns and models agree; otherwise you’ll see Neutral/Uncertain.”
	4.	“Real-time” vs “polling every 15–360 min”
	•	Backend docs are clear: scanners poll on schedules; you’re constrained by SEC/FDA rate limits.
	•	Traders will interpret “real-time” as “seconds, not minutes–hours.”
Concrete fix:
	•	Wording: “Near-real-time monitoring, refreshed every 15–360 minutes depending on source” instead of “real-time”.
	•	On Scanner Status tab, display the actual polling intervals with a simple label: “EDGAR: ~15 min, FDA: ~30–60 min…”.

3. Technical Review Perspective

Architecture strengths
	•	Backend
	•	Structured backend/ with:
	•	docs/ explaining scoring, invariants, direction logic.
	•	sql/ with schema definitions and view logic.
	•	tests/ with broad coverage:
test_xss.py, test_secrets.py, test_rate_limiting.py, test_scoring_market_data.py, test_data_quality.py, test_info_tier.py, etc.
	•	Good separation of concerns:
	•	Scanners
	•	Scoring layer
	•	ML (Market Echo Engine)
	•	API endpoints
	•	Access control / info tiers.
	•	Presence of end-to-end smoke tests and security-related tests suggests you’ve thought hard about robustness.
	•	Docs
	•	SCORING.md, SECURITY.md, EVALUATION_REPORT.md, INFO_TIERS.md, FEATURE_MAP.md form a coherent internal spec.
	•	SECURITY.md explicitly says “SOC2-inspired” rather than claiming certification; that’s appropriate.

Technical risks / improvement points
	1.	Feature surface vs. maintainability
	•	You’ve built a lot for a solo dev: scanners, ML, topology, alerts, community, API, dashboards, Stripe integration, etc.
	•	From an engineering manager perspective, the biggest risk is operational overhead:
	•	Many moving parts to keep healthy.
	•	Technical debt grows quickly.
Recommended approach:
	•	Identify the core production path:
	•	Event ingestion → scoring → trade signals → accuracy tracking.
	•	Non-core (but cool) parts—topology workspace, sentiment experiments, certain analytics views—should be clearly separated as “labs/experimental” in code and UI.
	2.	Monitoring & observability
	•	You have logs and data quality checks documented, but I see less about:
	•	Metrics export (Prometheus/OpenTelemetry).
	•	Centralized error tracking (Sentry-style).
	•	For a real-money product, this matters.
Next step:
	•	Even a minimal metrics layer:
	•	scanner success/failure counts
	•	queue delays
	•	API latency
	•	Wire these into a simple admin dashboard page (you already have Scanner Status; extend it).
	3.	ML lifecycle
	•	Market Echo Engine uses XGBoost, LightGBM, and a PyTorch MLP, with Ridge meta-learner.
	•	The docs mention training, but I don’t see full automation of:
	•	retraining cadence
	•	model registry / versioning
	•	rollback mechanism if a model underperforms.
Suggested minimal pipeline:
	•	Scheduled retrain job writes models to models/versioned/ with a METADATA.json including training dates, sample size, metrics.
	•	API reads only from a “current” symlink; rollback = repoint symlink.
	•	Accuracy dashboard should pull from those same metrics so marketing, UI, and backend are all aligned.
	4.	API design & rate limiting
	•	Tests suggest you have rate limiting and secrets handling. Good.
	•	I’d ensure:
	•	All external-facing endpoints that expose event data or signals enforce both plan-based gating and rate limiting.
	•	API keys scoped by plan, not just user.
	5.	Security vs. claims
	•	SECURITY.md is careful:
	•	You mention SOC2-inspired best practices, not certification.
	•	Emphasis on secret management, XSS prevention tests, least-privilege roles, etc.
	•	As long as your marketing mirrors this tone, you’re fine. Don’t ever say “SOC2-compliant” unless a third party audits you.

4. Casual Investor Perspective

This user:
	•	Trades occasionally.
	•	Wants to see if any of their few holdings (AAPL, MSFT, SPY, maybe 3–6 tickers) have important events.

What they’ll like
	•	Dashboard “Portfolio Value & Most Impactful Events” is friendly.
	•	Calendar + Events feed give a nice “what’s happening to my stocks this week?” view.

What overwhelms them
	•	Trade Signals, Modeling, Backtesting, Topology, X Sentiment—this all reads as “quant lab”.
	•	They will likely ignore 70% of your work unless you offer a simple mode.

Concrete feature for them:
	•	A “Casual mode” toggle or a separate landing:
	•	“Connect portfolio / upload CSV”
	•	Show:
	•	Upcoming important events for their holdings.
	•	Simple risk view: “Your portfolio is heavily exposed to Tech earnings this week.”
	•	No trade signals; maybe just “if you were an active trader, our models see mild bullish bias over the next 5 days.”

This isn’t required for launch, but it’s a potential future audience.

5. Finance Professor / Quant-Researcher Perspective

This persona cares about:
	•	Statistical rigor.
	•	Sample sizes.
	•	Overfitting.
	•	Clear description of methodology.

What’s strong
	•	SCORING.md describes deterministic scoring and direction logic clearly.
	•	EVALUATION_REPORT.md discusses:
	•	coverage statistics (e.g., proportion of neutral vs non-neutral events),
	•	average absolute returns,
	•	limitations (neutral bias, incomplete backtesting).
	•	The presence of topological methods (Takens embeddings, Vietoris–Rips, Betti numbers) is clearly documented, which they’ll find intellectually respectable.

What they’ll question
	1.	Data sufficiency
	•	Docs mention on the order of hundreds of labeled events for some horizons.
	•	A professor will note that this is thin for high-dimensional models and ensemble learning.
You’ve already admitted this in docs; just make sure marketing never implies “huge institutional-grade dataset”.
	2.	Look-ahead / survivorship bias
	•	I can’t fully confirm from code how you handle:
	•	ignoring data that wasn’t known at the time,
	•	delisted companies,
	•	event timestamp alignment.
	•	A professor would immediately ask for this.
At minimum:
	•	Add explicit lines to Backtesting and Evaluation pages:
	•	“Backtests avoid look-ahead bias by only using data available at event time.”
	•	“Survivorship bias is partially mitigated by including delisted tickers where data is available, but not fully eliminated.”
	3.	Multiple testing / strategy mining
	•	With many event types and strategies, they’ll ask: “How did you adjust for trying many things?”
	•	You don’t need a full formal correction, but you should acknowledge this risk in docs.

⸻

6. 50-Year Programmer Perspective

Think: pragmatic, suspicious of complexity, hates over-architecture.

What they’ll like
	•	Clear directory structure and docs.
	•	Presence of tests, especially around security and correctness.
	•	Markdown-heavy documentation; not everything is in someone’s head.

What will trigger them
	1.	Scope creep
	•	For one person, this codebase is large:
	•	complex scanners, event types, topological analytics, AI chat, backtests, alerts, forum, etc.
	•	They’ll say: “Pick the killer feature and make it bulletproof. Everything else is debt.”
	2.	Tech novelty vs. user value
	•	Persistent homology, Takens embeddings, 3D plots—this looks like a fun PhD project.
	•	They’ll ask: “Exactly how often does this change a trading decision, and by how much?”
That’s not a reason to delete it, but you should explicitly tag it as “experimental analytics” in both UI and code.
	3.	Operational complexity
	•	They’ll press you on logging, monitoring, auto-restarts, backup, and recovery.
	•	My earlier comments about observability align with what they’d insist on.

⸻

Marketing & Accuracy Alignment

Based on the docs I saw, here are potential over-promise pitfalls to fix before launch:
	1.	Accuracy claims
	•	You currently have moving win-rate numbers (e.g., 66% → 72%).
	•	Make sure every public claim includes:
	•	time window (e.g., “last 90 days”),
	•	sample size,
	•	horizon (1-day vs 5-day),
	•	explicit disclaimer.
	2.	Real-time vs. scheduled scanning
	•	Say “event-driven scanning on 15–360 minute intervals” instead of “real-time”.
	3.	Security
	•	Keep using “SOC2-inspired practices”; never call yourself SOC2-certified.
	4.	AI branding
	•	Marketing/README mentions “RadarQuant AI: GPT-5.1 assistant”.
	•	That’s not necessary and will go stale. Better wording:
	•	“RadarQuant AI: GPT-class large language model assistant for portfolio and event analysis.”
	5.	Feature vs. roadmap
	•	If any features described in FEATURE_MAP.md or ROADMAP.md are not actually wired into the current build (e.g., full community forum, some webhook options), do not list them as live features on Pricing/Product pages. Put them under “Upcoming”.

⸻

Concrete Next Steps Before Launch

1. Tighten the core story
	•	Update homepage and Product page to clearly say:
Impact Radar helps swing traders trade events—earnings, FDA approvals, SEC filings—by turning them into structured trade setups with defined entries, stops, and targets.
	•	Move “Playbooks” and “Trade Signals” to the center of the value proposition.

2. Adjust UI for workflow clarity
	•	Add “Getting Started” checklist on Dashboard.
	•	Add “Playbook Library” as a primary nav item.
	•	Mark Modeling / Topology as “Advanced (Experimental)” in both UI and docs.
	•	On each Event and Signal card, show:
	•	Horizon (1d/5d/20d)
	•	Expected move magnitude band (e.g., “typical +/-0.8%”)
	•	Confidence label (Low/Med/High).

3. Align marketing with reality
	•	Go through:
	•	/product
	•	/pricing
	•	/backtesting
	•	/market-echo
	•	/security
	•	any “accuracy” or “performance” copy.
	•	For each claim, check against:
	•	INFO_TIERS.md – is this feature really unlocked at that tier?
	•	SCORING.md and EVALUATION_REPORT.md – are we overstating predictive power?
	•	SECURITY.md – are we overstating compliance?

Where in doubt, down-shift the language:
	•	“Our models currently achieve X% win rate over Y trades in the last Z days”
instead of
	•	“We consistently achieve X% directional accuracy”.

4. Minimum observability

Before letting real users in:
	•	Ensure scanner errors and API failures surface to:
	•	An admin dashboard section, and
	•	Logs with clear severity levels.
	•	Add a simple “System Health” widget on your internal admin page:
	•	Scanners up/down,
	•	Last successful run times,
	•	Number of recent failures.

5. Legal and risk disclosure
	•	Add a visible “Risk & Disclaimer” page and link it in footer and onboarding:
	•	Not financial advice.
	•	No guarantee of performance.
	•	Backtests / historical accuracy limitations.

⸻

After Launch: What to Focus On
	1.	Tight feedback loop with early users
	•	Invite a small group (10–30 traders).
	•	Watch how they actually use Events → Trade Signals → Broker.
	•	Ask them: “What would you miss the most if I removed it?” That tells you which features to double down on.
	2.	Instrument the funnel
	•	Track:
	•	homepage → account created
	•	account created → first portfolio upload / watchlist edit
	•	first event viewed
	•	first signal viewed
	•	See where people drop off and simplify that step.
	3.	Content as acquisition
	•	Use your own system to generate weekly “Event Briefings”:
	•	“How the market reacted to last week’s FDA approvals.”
	•	“Earnings Beat Playbook: Gap & Go vs Gap & Fade.”
	•	Every piece of content includes annotated screenshots of Impact Radar + email capture.
	4.	Iterate on playbooks
	•	For each playbook, track:
	•	number of matched events
	•	backtested performance
	•	live performance
	•	Retire or revise weak playbooks, and highlight strong ones in UI and marketing.

⸻

Limitations of My Review
	•	I cannot actually click through your live site or run the backend; I’m inferring behavior from:
	•	the code and tests,
	•	your markdown docs,
	•	the GIFs.
	•	I can’t see CSS/layout bugs, browser-specific issues, or performance under load.
