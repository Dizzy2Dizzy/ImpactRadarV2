Good, this is exactly the kind of counter-feedback you want.

Here’s how I’d synthesize your review + Replit’s comments into something you can actually execute.

⸻

1. Where you and Replit should “lock in” agreement

These are now settled requirements, not suggestions:
	1.	Onboarding / “What do I do first?”
	•	This is non-negotiable.
	•	You need:
	•	A short “Getting Started” checklist on the Dashboard, and
	•	A simple written guide (or short Loom/GIF) that shows:
	1.	Add watchlist / upload portfolio
	2.	Open Events
	3.	Open Trade Signals
	4.	Click the matching Playbook
	5.	Set up alerts
	2.	Playbooks are core, not auxiliary
	•	Replit is right: don’t hide them; don’t treat them as a blog.
	•	Minimum:
	•	A dedicated Playbooks tab in the left nav.
	•	“Matches Playbook: …” on Event + Signal cards.
	•	For each playbook: setup conditions, entry logic, stop/target template, historical stats, example chart.
	3.	Honesty about data latency
	•	Replace every “real-time” phrase with:
	•	“near–real-time, refreshed every 15–360 minutes depending on data source.”
	•	Do this everywhere: marketing site, docs, in-app copy.
	4.	Accuracy + sample size front and center
	•	You now have live performance improving from 66% → 72%. Great.
	•	But it must always be accompanied by:
	•	Horizon (1d / 5d / 20d)
	•	Window (e.g., last 90 days)
	•	Sample size (N trades)
	•	Put this:
	•	On the Accuracy page as simple tiles, and
	•	As a small badge on each signal:
“5-day model • 72% win rate • N = 143 (last 90d)”
	5.	Execution helpers
	•	You don’t need deep broker integration for V1.
	•	But you do need frictionless handoff:
	•	“Copy entry/stop/target” button per signal.
	•	If you can, a one-liner summary like
“Long TSLA, 2.6% of account, entry 429.52, SL 408.04, TP 468.18”.

Those 5 things should go into your immediate sprint.

2. Where I still stand by my earlier push, with nuance

Replit’s pushback is reasonable, but here’s how I’d frame it.

“Too much analytic surface area”
	•	I’m not saying “delete Modeling / Correlation / Backtesting.”
	•	I’m saying hierarchy:
	•	For paying traders, the primary loop is:
	•	Events → Playbook → Signal → Trade.
	•	Topology, shape explorers, and backtesting are:
	•	Either research tools for you,
	•	Or toys/power-features for a tiny quant-nerd subset.

So:
	•	Keep everything visible in the sidebar.
	•	But:
	•	Group them under “Advanced Research” or “Labs”.
	•	Add small “Experimental / Advanced” labels.
	•	Don’t let them visually compete with Events / Signals / Playbooks.

That way you still impress the quants without confusing everyone else about what the product is for.

“Casual mode toggle”

Agree with Replit: skip this for now.
	•	It’s scope creep and will fork your UX.
	•	Instead, design a single path that:
	•	Feels clear to “serious retail trader”
	•	But still keeps advanced stuff discoverable to power users.

3. Concrete next steps (short list for your next dev session)

If I had to give you a “do these in this order” list:
	1.	Copy audit (30–60 min)
	•	Search project for:
	•	“real-time”, “real time”
	•	“SOC2”
	•	Any wording that sounds like hard guarantees.
	•	Replace with:
	•	“near–real-time (15–360 min polling)”
	•	“SOC2-inspired practices (not certified)”
	•	“estimates / forecasts / modeled scenarios” instead of “predictions” where appropriate.
	2.	Dashboard: Getting Started box
	•	Card at the top or right side:
	•	Add watchlist or portfolio
	•	View today’s events
	•	Open trade signals
	•	Open a playbook
	•	Turn on email/SMS alerts
	•	Checkmarks persist in the DB.
	3.	Playbooks: promote + wire in
	•	Add left-nav item: Playbooks under TRADING.
	•	Design a simple card:
	•	Name, setup conditions, horizon
	•	Win rate, avg R, #trades
	•	“View example events”
	•	On each event/signal:
	•	Show a chip linking the matching playbook.
	4.	Accuracy tiles + signal badges
	•	Accuracy page:
	•	Three tiles per horizon: win rate, MAE, N trades, date range.
	•	Signal cards:
	•	Tiny grey line at the bottom:
“Model: 5d • 72% win rate (N=143, last 90d)”
	5.	Execution helpers
	•	Add “Copy trade plan” button:
	•	Copies entry, stop, target, position size.
	•	(Later, you can let advanced users export to CSV / webhook to their broker.)
	6.	Label advanced features
	•	In sidebar:
	•	Add “Advanced” label next to Modeling, Topology, Strategy Lab.
	•	On those pages, small banner:
	•	“Advanced research module. Not required for basic event/signal trading.”

Do those and you’ve addressed 80% of both my and Replit’s critique in a very short time.

4. After that: how to prepare for real users

Once those changes ship:
	1.	Soft launch with a very small cohort (10–30 users).
	2.	Force yourself to watch them use the tool:
	•	Where do they click first?
	•	Do they discover Playbooks without you telling them?
	•	Do they understand what to do with a Signal?
	3.	Track:
	•	of users who:
	•	Upload a portfolio,
	•	Open Trade Signals,
	•	Click “Copy trade plan,”
	•	Return within 7 days.
	4.	Use that to decide:
	•	Which playbooks to expand,
	•	Whether you need to simplify anything else,
	•	What kind of content (email briefings, case studies) actually drives logins.

If you want, next step we can pick one surface (e.g., Pricing page or Playbooks tab) and I’ll rewrite it line-by-line to match exactly what the current backend does, keep you honest legally, and position this as a $50/mo tool for event-driven traders—not just a beautiful quant toy.
