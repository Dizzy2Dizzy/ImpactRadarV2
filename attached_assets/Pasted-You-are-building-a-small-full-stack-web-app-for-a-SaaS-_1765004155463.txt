You are building a small full-stack web app for a SaaS product called **Impact Radar**, an event-driven swing trading analytics platform.

GOAL

Create:
1) A **playbook feature** that makes “battle-tested playbooks” a first-class, navigable feature (not just blog posts).
2) A **content + email list system** for a recurring “Impact Radar Event Briefing” (blog-style posts + email capture).
3) A **one-page “Impact Radar for Earnings Traders” playbook** page that can be exported to PDF and used as a lead magnet delivered after email signup.

Use:
- Framework: Next.js (App Router preferred) or React + simple Node/Express.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS.
- Storage: In-memory or simple JSON file for subscribers and placeholder content (I’ll hook it to real services later).


=====================
APP STRUCTURE
=====================

Create a Next.js (or React) app with these main routes:

- `/` – Landing page + email capture + teaser of playbooks and posts.
- `/briefing` – List of “Impact Radar Event Briefing” posts (blog index).
- `/briefing/[slug]` – Individual post page.
- `/playbooks` – Playbook Library index page (first-class feature).
- `/playbooks/[slug]` – Individual playbook details.
- `/playbook/earnings-traders` – One-page “Impact Radar for Earnings Traders” playbook suitable for PDF export.
- `/api/subscribe` – API endpoint to capture email subscribers (POST).

You can hardcode posts and playbooks as JSON arrays or TypeScript objects for now.


=====================
1) PLAYBOOK FEATURE – FIRST-CLASS LIBRARY
=====================

Create a **Playbook Library** as a central feature:

ROUTE: `/playbooks`

This page should:
- Show a grid of “playbook cards” with:
  - Title
  - Short description
  - Tags (e.g. “Earnings”, “FDA”, “8-K”, “Long”, “Short”, “5d horizon”)
  - “View Playbook” button linking to the detail page.

Seed it with at least these 3 playbooks:

1. **“Earnings Beat, Gap < 8%, Uptrend”**
   - Setup conditions:
     - EPS/revenue beat.
     - Opening gap up < ~8%.
     - Stock above 50-day moving average or clearly in an uptrend.
   - Entry logic:
     - Enter on constructive pullback toward intraday support or prior day close.
   - Stop/target template:
     - Stop: 1.5–2× ATR below entry or below key support.
     - Target: 1–3× risk or prior swing high.
   - Include placeholders for:
     - Historical stats (win rate, avg R, sample size).
     - Example charts/events.

2. **“FDA Approval on Small-Cap Biotech”**
   - Setup conditions:
     - FDA approval event on small-cap healthcare/biotech.
     - Impact score high.
   - Entry logic:
     - Enter on controlled pullback after initial spike OR next-day continuation if volume remains strong.
   - Stop/target template:
     - Volatility-adjusted stop; partial profit-taking on parabolic moves.

3. **“Negative 8-K: Exec Departure in Mid-Cap”**
   - Setup conditions:
     - SEC 8-K with Item related to exec departure (e.g. 5.02).
     - Negative direction classification.
   - Entry logic:
     - Short or puts on failed bou
