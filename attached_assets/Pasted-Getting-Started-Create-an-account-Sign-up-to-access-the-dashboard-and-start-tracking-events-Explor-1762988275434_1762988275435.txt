Understanding Impact Scores
Every event gets three key metrics:

Impact Score (0-100)
How significant the event is. Higher scores mean bigger potential impact. Calculated using sector analysis, timing, market conditions, and event type.

Direction
Whether the event is likely positive, negative, neutral, or uncertain for the stock price.

Confidence (0-100%)
How confident the system is about the impact and direction. Higher confidence means the prediction is more reliable based on historical patterns.
